# NHTSA ADS and ADAS Level 2 Collision Data Analysis

This project involves an in-depth analysis of collision data for Level 2 and Automated Driving Systems (ADS)-equipped vehicles on public roads, as mandated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The aim is to summarize and model various aspects of these collisions and compare them with human-driven vehicles.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Analysis**
   - **Geospatial Analysis**: Breakdown of collisions by city, state, etc.
   - **Factor Analysis**: Examination of factors such as road type, weather conditions, and speed.
   - **Crash Analysis**: Analysis of injury severity, contact area, pre-crash movement, etc.
   - **Reporting and Safety Analysis**: Examination of reporting practices and safety outcomes.

2. **Comparison Analysis**
   - Conduct comparative analyses between ADS/ADAS Level 2 vehicles and human-driven vehicles focusing on crash factors and outcomes.

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Development of a machine learning model to predict crash occurrences using the ADS and ADAS Level 2 data.

## Analysis Conducted

### 1. ADS and ADAS Level 2 Data Analysis

- **Geospatial Analysis**:
  - City-wise distribution
  - State-wise distribution

  - Pre-Crash Movement

- **Reporting and Safety Analysis**:
  - Analysis of reporting trends
  - Safety outcome evaluations

### 2. Comparison with Human-Driven Vehicles

- **Factor Analysis**: Comparison of various factors influencing crashes.
- **Crash Analysis**: Detailed comparison of crash data.

### 3. Predictive Modeling

- **Machine Learning Model**: A model to predict potential crash scenarios for ADS and ADAS Level 2 vehicles.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: - [NHTSA Crash Reporting](https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting#overview)
- **Analysis**: Run all_data_analysis.py for different analysis.
- **Reports**: Summary reports and findings.
- **Presentations**: Slides and visuals summarizing the analysis.

## Results

The results of the analyses, including the geospatial, factor, and crash analyses, as well as the comparison studies and predictive models, are presented in detail in the reports and presentations. Key findings and insights are highlighted to understand the differences between ADS/ADAS Level 2 vehicles and human-driven vehicles in terms of collision factors and outcomes.
